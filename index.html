            We created the basis for the startup Fayvor.  We turned their pencil and paper business into an online one by hosting their server and services on an EC2 server using AWS.
            All of the code was stored on CodeCommit with the database being set up using RDS.  Then we created python scripts that would run on their website that would take the information
            inside google sheets linked to surveys.  Each survey response would be added to our decision tree mathcing algorithm to determine the best possible match between a caretaker and a
            client to ensure the best service.

            UNC-CH Esports Club is one of the fastest growing clubs on campus due to the popularity of Esports as a medium and more attention brought to it by the media.  There are over 10 video games represented with their respective genres.  As treasurer,
            I gained sponsorships for our largest event of the year, Gamefest.  I implemented a due system, fundraising, benefit nights, and Facebook ads in order to increase membership within the club and start bringing in revenue.  As a result,
            we were the most profitable we have ever been with our officers not having to put money out of pocket for their respective games.
